# Markdown => HTML Doc Generator

## Wtf is this shit
Just a simple way to generate documentation for a project. Good for
handing off to a third party developer or a client. It will output
HTML files from your markdown files and then automatically generate
a table of contents and a jump menu for going to sections of your
documents.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo (duh)
2. Run `$ npm install`
3. Run `$ grunt watch`
4. Start creating markdown files and placing them in the `md` directory
5. Go to the `docs` folder in your favorite web browser
6. ?????
7. PROFIT!
